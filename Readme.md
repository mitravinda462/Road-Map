# Road Map
It is a simple implementation a travel planner using graph data structure.
This program supports the following funtions:
1) Creation of an undirected graph with destination names as nodes and time of travel between destinations as weights of the edges.
2) Addition of a new destination.
3) Addition of a new edge between 2 desitnations.
4) Calculation of the shortest paths from a source to all destinations using Djikstra's algorithm.
5) Calculation of minmum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm.
